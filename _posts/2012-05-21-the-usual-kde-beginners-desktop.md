Every now and then I'm visting my best friend's mom (generation > 50a) to update
her old Pentium 4 system with the last [opensuse][opensuse] software. Each time,
I have to restore her Desktop to provide the basic features like managing opened
windows, add the clock again, etc. Each time, I pay carefully attention to lock
the screen afterwards. Sometimes I get doubts, that they are just fooling me, but my
friend declined this, of course.

This time they disarranged the screen in a very extreme way[^1]. Take it for amusement
or for considering a clearer warning of unlocking the screen. I vote for:

> You might end with a coruppted system!   
> Please copy this into the form field below:   
> I asked my son's friend and got his permission.

:wink:

[^1]: Did you recognize these empty plasma panels on each edge of the screen
      which prevents all application to get maximized properly?
